# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.

Using unlabeled data, discover patterns, clusters or significant components

- Clustering:
if we have unlabeled data, can we attempt to cluster or group similar data points together to "discover" possible labels for clusters ? 
Using features, group together data rows into distinct clusters.

- Dimensionality Reduction:
if we have unlabeled data, can we attempt to reduce the number of features by combining them into new components ? Do these new components give us further insight for the data ?
Using features, discover how to combine and reduce into fewer components.
