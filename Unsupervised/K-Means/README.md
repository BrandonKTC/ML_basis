# K-Means

- Step 1 : Choose the number of clusters to create (this is the K value).
- Step 2 : Randomly select K distinct data points.
- Step 3 : Assign each remaining point to the nearest "cluster" point.
- Step 4 : Calculate the center of the cluster points (mean value of each point vector).
- Step 5 : Assign each point to the nearest cluster center.

## Choosing K:
to choose an optimal K value we use the elbow method is a graphical method where The optimal K value is the point at which the graph forms an elbow

## Clustering
clustering uses unlabeled data and looks for similarities between groups (clusters) in order to attempt to segment the data into separete clusters.

## Properties:
- Each point must belong to a cluster
- Each point can only belong to one cluster (no single point can belong to multiple clusters).
