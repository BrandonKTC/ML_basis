# Principal Component Analysis

- Dimensionality Reduction algorithms such as PCA do not simply choose a subset of the existing features.
they create new dimensional components that are combinations of proportions of the existing features.

## PCA Outcomes:

- Reduce number of dimensions in data.
- Show which features explain the most variance in the data.

### Variance Explained

Principal Component is a linear combination of original features, The more variance the original feature accounts for, the more influence is has over the principal components.
