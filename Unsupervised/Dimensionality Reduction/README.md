# Dimension Reduction:

- Imagine a dataset with 30+ features, how would you understand the key features?
Visualization and Data Analysis have limitations when the number of feature dimensions increases.

- Helps visualize and understand complex data sets.
Can also act as a simpler data set for training data for ML algorithms.

- Helps reduce N features to a diserd smaller set of components through a transformation

# Dimensionality Reduction Outcomes:

- Understand which features describe the most variance in the data set.
- Aid human understanding of large feature sets, especially through visualization.

## Varience Explained

Mesure the proportion to which each feature accounts for dispersion in the data set.
