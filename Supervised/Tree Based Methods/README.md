# Three Based Methods
Each of these methods stems from the basic decision tree algorithm
Decision Tree Learning refers to the statistical modeling that uses a form of decision trees, where node splits are decided based on an information metric.

- decision trees and other tree based methods rely on the ability to split data based on information from features.
- This mean we need a mathematical definition of information and the ability to measure it.

## MODELS:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Boosting Methods
