# Regression algorithms:
The key objective of regression-based tasks is to predict output labels or responses which are continues NUMERIC values based on historical feature data.

## MODELS:
- linear Regression
- SVC Regression

## MAE:
simply (y - y hat) and since prediction can be above or below the true value we take the mean absolute value of the sum
- don't count large errors

## MSE:
also (y - y hat)^2 since the value are squared Larger errors are "punished" more than with MAE
- reports units of y in squared!

## RMSE:
do exactly the same thing as MSE and squared root the value of y so the units are "logic again"
