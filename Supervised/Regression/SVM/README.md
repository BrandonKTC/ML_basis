# Support Vector Machines
- The main idea behind SVM is that we can use Hyperplanes to create a separation between classes.
- Then new points will fall on one side of this separating hyperplane, which we can then use to assign a class.

## Kernels
kernels allows us to move beyond a Support Vector Classifier and use Support Vector Machines.
There are a variety of kernels we can use to "project" the features to a higher dimension.

# Regression
use the margin to try to connect and get the best "fit" model possible
