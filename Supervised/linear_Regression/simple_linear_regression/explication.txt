Residuals:
- residual errors should be random and close to a normal distribution (on a kde plot (close to 0))
Residual plot shows residual arror vs. true y value:
- there should be no clear line or curve. (on the points)

MAE:
simply (y - y hat) and since prediction can be above or below the true value we take the mean absolute value of the sum
- don't count large errors

MSE:
also (y - y hat)^2 since the value are squared Larger errors are "punished" more than with MAE
- reports units of y in squared!

RMSE:
do exactly the same thing as MSE and squared root the value of y so the units are "logic again" 

y = mx + b

Gradient Descent:
find the best Beta value to minimize the squared error.(b)

Cost Functions:
a "best-fit" line is define by minimizing the squared error.(m)

simple linear regression : include dealing with only 1 x feature and 1 y label to predict y hat.
linear regression deals with multiple (n) x features
