y = mx + b

Gradient Descent:
find the best Beta value to minimize the squared error.(b)

Cost Functions:
a "best-fit" line is define by minimizing the squared error.(m)

simple linear regression : include dealing with only 1 x feature and 1 y label to predict y hat.
linear regression deals with multiple (n) x features
